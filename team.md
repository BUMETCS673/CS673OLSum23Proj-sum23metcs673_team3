## About Team 3

### Corydon (Cory) Wood

I'm originally from Colorado, but came out to Boston for undergrad, and ended up staying. I work full time as a cloud platform architect for a pharmaceutical company in Cambridge
Massachusetts. My team is primarily focused on building and maintaining an AWS based cloud environment
which can be used to host our enterprise applications. Over the last year I have
taken an interest in Terraform and have been focused on redesigning our infrastructure deployment pipelines. Outside of work and school
I enjoy playing hockey, skiing, and hiking.

### Umamaheswar Edara(ANPCI)

I hail from Visakhapatnam, a coastal city in India renowned for its scenic beauty and serene seas. I made the journey to Boston to pursue my Master's degree, driven by a passion for technology and software development. With two years of experience as a 5G software developer, I have honed my skills in this cutting-edge domain. I like playing football and I seek adventure through challenging hikes and embark on long drives.

### Jasmine (JasNotTheGenre) Hughes

I'm from PA (Pennsylvania) and I currently live in Lowell, MA. I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Science and have plans to pursue the Digital Forensics field. For work I take photos of K-12 students for picture day, photograph graduating seniors during their graduation, and do camera work for Harvard Athletics. Water polo, ice hockey, and rugby are my favorite sports to capture thus far. I enjoy playing video games, playing trombone, and crocheting random yet practical items (like trombone dish cloths).

### Zuowen Tang (Eldoov)

I am a current master's student specializing in Cryptography within the Computer Science Security branch. Despite my technical pursuits now, my academic journey began in the realm of Philosophy and Humanities, giving me a unique perspective on my current field. I'm also very interested in board games and video games. Currently, I'm building a new role-play system called _Torchlight_ (like DnD 5e or Pathfinder) with friends. (update for screen-shot)
