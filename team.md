## About Team 3 

### Corydon (Cory) Wood

---
I'm originally from Colorado, but came out to Boston for undergrad, and ended up staying. I work full time as a cloud platform architect for a pharmaceutical company in Cambridge
Massachusetts. My team is primarily focused on building and maintaining an AWS based cloud environment
which can be used to host our enterprise applications. Over the last year I have
taken an interest in Terraform and have been focused on redesigning our infrastructure deployment pipelines. Outside of work and school
I enjoy playing hockey, skiing, and hiking.

### Umamaheswar edara (ANPCI)

I hail from Visakhapatnam, a coastal city in India renowned for its scenic beauty and serene seas. I made the journey to Boston to pursue my Master's degree, driven by a passion for technology and software development. With two years of experience as a 5G software developer, I have honed my skills in this cutting-edge domain. I like playing football and I seek adventure through challenging hikes and embark on long drives.
